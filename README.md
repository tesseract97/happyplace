App to get my day started in the morning

**Idea for app:**

Good morning app that loads upon starting your computer with a pleasing background image and easy links to your favorite sites. 

**Features:**

* Neural network that finds art online and is being trained to pick art that the user likes.

* Favorite sites are stored and easily updated/deleted. (???)

* Opportunity for me to work on my terrible frontend skills.

* Maybe Other Things?? The app should just be a happy place to start your day.

Uses/ Will Use

* Flask/Python

* HTML/ CSS

* MongoDB

* Docker

* Vuex?

* ??

**NONE OF THIS IS COMPLETED, STILL WORKING ON THE SKELETON**

**Neural Network Logic Algorithm:**

TBD
